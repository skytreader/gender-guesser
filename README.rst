This package uses the underlying data from the program "gender" by Jorg Michael (described `here <http://www.autohotkey.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=22000>`_).  Its use is pretty straightforward::

    >>> import gender_guesser.detector as gender
    >>> d = gender.Detector()
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Bob"))
    male
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Sally"))
    female
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Pauley")) # should be androgynous
    andy

The result will be one of ``unknown`` (name not found), ``andy`` (androgynous), ``male``, ``female``, ``mostly_male``, or ``mostly_female``. The difference between ``andy`` and ``unknown`` is that the former is found to have the same probability to be male than to be female, while the later means that the name wasn't found in the database.

I18N is fully supported::

    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"\xc1lfr\xfan"))  # u"Álfrún"
    female

Additionally, you can give preference to specific countries::

    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Jamie"))
    mostly_female
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Jamie", u'great_britain'))
    mostly_male

Additionally, you can create a detector that is not case sensitive (default *is* to be case sensitive)::

    >>> d = gender.Detector(case_sensitive=False)
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"sally"))
    female
    >>> print(d.get_gender(u"Sally"))
    female

Try to avoid creating many Detectors, as each creation means reading the data file.

This is a fork of `gender-guesser packagee by lead-ratings <https://github.com/lead-ratings/gender-guesser>` which in itself is a fork of the ``SexMachine`` package by `Ferhat Elmas <https://github.com/ferhatelmas>`_. It was created to be able to publish a Python 3 compatible version to PyPI and to be able add some more improvements without bugging the original author.
